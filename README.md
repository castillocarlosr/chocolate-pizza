# Wireframe Exercise

### About:  Early wireframe-exercise attempts

This is part of my early days building wireframes for mock websites.
       The idea is to create a quick mock up display of what a website would like to a client.
       Similar to making a blueprint before building an actual website.
       This was to help me better align my HTML and CSS skills with alignment and layout.
